## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide
Follow **PEP 8** conventions:

```python
# Good
def calculate_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Calculate classification accuracy.
    
    Args:
        y_true: True labels
        y_pred: Predicted labels
        
    Returns:
        float: Accuracy score
    """
    return np.mean(y_true == y_pred)


# Bad
def calc_acc(y,yp):
    return np.mean(y==yp)
```

### Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] Follows PEP 8 style guide
- [ ] Includes docstrings for all functions
- [ ] Has meaningful variable names
- [ ] Includes comments for complex logic
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use constants)
- [ ] Handles errors gracefully
- [ ] Is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

### Documentation Strings
Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def train_model(X_train, y_train, model_type='logistic'):
    """
    Train a classification model.
    
    This function trains a specified model type on the provided
    training data and returns the fitted model object.
    
    Args:
        X_train (pd.DataFrame): Training features
        y_train (pd.Series): Training labels
        model_type (str, optional): Model type to train. 
            Options: 'logistic', 'knn', 'svm'. Defaults to 'logistic'.
    
    Returns:
        object: Fitted scikit-learn model
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If model_type is not recognized
        
    Example:
        >>> X_train, y_train = load_data()
        >>> model = train_model(X_train, y_train, 'logistic')
        >>> print(model.score(X_test, y_test))
    """
    # Implementation
```

pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=.

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_preprocessing.py
```

### Writing Tests
```python
import pytest
import pandas as pd
from preprocessing import clean_sensor_data

def test_remove_unavailable_states():
    """Test that 'unavailable' states are removed."""
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'state': ['on', 'unavailable', 'off', 'unknown'],
        'sensor': ['light', 'light', 'light', 'light']
    })
    
    result = clean_sensor_data(df)
    
    assert len(result) == 2
    assert 'unavailable' not in result['state'].values
    assert 'unknown' not in result['state'].values
```

## Documentation

### Types of Documentation

#### Code Comments
```python
# Use comments to explain WHY, not WHAT
# Good
# Stratified split maintains class proportions in imbalanced data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, stratify=y, random_state=42
)

# Bad
# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
```

#### Docstrings
- Every public function must have a docstring
- Include Args, Returns, Raises, and Examples
- Keep them up-to-date with code changes

#### README Updates
- Update README.md when adding major features
- Keep installation instructions current
- Update examples if API changes

#### CHANGELOG
